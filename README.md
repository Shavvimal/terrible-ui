# Terrible UI

# Goal

- intentionally poor user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design
  - [Bad UI Battles](https://goulartnogueira.github.io/BadUI/): Inspired by the subreddit r/badUIbattles, this project compiles intentionally bad UI designs, including interactive examples like a phone number slider selector and a challenging date picker.
- Have an Agent that can help you add things to this website.
